We pride ourselves in paying attention to human interaction. While the
support aliases described in the previous section must be used whenever
you want something to be done, you may want to know something about the
major roles in our department that are applicable to computing.

- **Chairperson**: `Konstantin Läufer`_. Please contact the Chairperson with any
  suggestions you have for improvement, especially when itcomes to computing
  matters.  The chairperson has the ultimate reponsibility for all department
  matters, especially the departmental computing budget.
- **Computing Director**: `George K. Thiruvathukal`_. Pleasecontact the
  Computing Director with any suggestions you have for improvement or with
  technical support questions. The Computing Director is ultimatelyresponsible
  for the implementation of all computing initiatives for the department, in
  particular those that support our teaching and research missions.
- **Lab Manager**: `Miao Ye`_. The Lab Manager is ultimately responsible for
  the implementation of the intiaitives as defined by the Computing Director
  (who consults with the Chairperson). Because there is onlyone Lab Manager at
  the moment, it is important to recognize that he/she works to support all
  requests in a timely manner but may not be ableto resolve your problem
  immediately. Please allow 24-48 hours for a response to any non-emergency
  need.
- **Computing Committee**: `George K. Thiruvathukal`_ (Computing Director
  and Committee Chair), `Konstantin Läufer`_, Prof. Stephen Doty, and two
  new members to be determined (one more faculty and one more student member).
  The Compting Committee meets at least twice per academic year and drafts
  recommendations and resolutions for future computing initiatives that support
  the department's teaching and researchmission and those of collaborating
  departments. The commitee's proceedings are reported to the Chairperson.

In most cases, you should contact the **Lab Manager**
