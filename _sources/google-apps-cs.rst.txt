The CS and Mathematics departments subscribe to Google Apps for Your Domain.
Among other things, we can host sites, e-mail, documents, calendaring, etc. Our
primary use at the moment is for Google Sites, which allows individuals,
workgroups (e.g. project teams in classes), research groups, and other
collaborations to host their own private or public web sites. While this
software is officially in beta, it's already proving to be a winner for many
needs. Moreover, we can assign you your own hostname within one of the 3
domains. Examples include `www.etl.luc.edu`_, `gkt.etl.luc.edu`_,
`doty.math.luc.edu`_, and `tonyg.math.luc.edu`_.

We reserve the right to terminate any Google site that contains inappropriate
content or is reported to Google or us as being offensive.  So we ask that if
you have such uses in mind to consider setting up your own Google Site that is
not connected to LUC or the department proper.  We are not generally taking
advantage of e-mail and other services at this time and reserve these address
for faculty and researchers officially connected to the department. To request
a Google Site or other service, please see :doc:`getting-help`.
