Content Management and Hosting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We no longer provide support for static web page serving, PHP, and CGI
scripting. We realize that this might be an inconvenience to some. For students
doing project work, we can provide temporary :doc:`virtual machines
</virtualization>` on our Xen cluster for web hosting projects.

We encourage those who need to set up web sites to consider establishing web
hosting account via one of the many providers out there, such as Site 5
(`http://www.site5.com <http://www.site5.com>`_), which has hosting plans as
low as $5/month that give you full shell access and the ability to set up your
own domain name, etc.

We are able to provide many services (private or public sites) through
:doc:`google-apps-cs`; however, this may not give you all of the
scripting and programming capabilities that are desired.
