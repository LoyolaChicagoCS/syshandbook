Groupwise Instant Messaging
===========================

Loyola supports instant messaging at gwim.luc.edu on port 8300. This can be
accessed from anywhere and does not require the use of a VPN. To connect, you
either need the Groupwise client but can also use the Adium and Pidgin instant
messaging client. Just use the Groupwise protocol.
