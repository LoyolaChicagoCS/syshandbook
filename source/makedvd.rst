Create CD/DVD from ISO Image
============================

Many downloaded software products are ISO image files. An ISO image file
is an exact representation of a CD/DVD. You may write an image file to a
blank CD/DVD to get an identical copy of the original CD/DVD. Simply
performing a direct copy of an ISO image file to a CD/DVD will not write
the directory and file structure needed to use that CD/DVD.

Most CD/DVD writing software includes a feature to create a CD/DVD from
an image file.

There are several free programs, e.g. `ImgBurn <http://www.imgburn.com/>`_.

Users on Mac OS X should use the Disk Utility, found in Applications
-> Utilities -> Disk Utility.

Users on Ubuntu Linux should use Brasero.
