Windows Desktop Support
=======================

Windows desktop matters are handled by ITS. If you are experiencing trouble with Windows labs and other ITS issues, please open a support ticket using the ITS Self Service application, https://heatss.it.luc.edu/HeatLDAP/. Linux and Mac desktop matters are the responsibility of individual faculty. We do not provide desktop support.

Note: As of June 30, 2010, we no longer provide desktop computing support in the department. These needs are addressed by the ITS desktop support group. This change does not prevent users from establishing their own standalone desktop setup but we are focusing our efforts on non-commodity needs that are synergistic with advanced teaching/research needs.
