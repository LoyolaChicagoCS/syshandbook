Loyola VPN Access
=================

There are a number of services (read: ports) that are firewalled because they're not secure. The university VPN allows you to access these non-secure services.

There is a self-signup process via ITS: http://www.luc.edu/its/security/vpn_overview.shtml. We recommend that all students working on advanced projects to get access to the VPN so they will run into few(er) surprises.
