Loyola VPN Access
=================

There are a number of services (read: ports) that are firewalled because
they're not secure. The university VPN allows you to access these non-secure
services.

There is a self-signup process via ITS:
http://www.luc.edu/helpdesk/resources/vpn.shtml. We recommend that all students
working on advanced projects to get access to the VPN so they will run into
few(er) surprises.
