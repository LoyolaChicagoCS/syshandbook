Many downloaded software products are ISO image files. An ISO image file is an
exact representation of a CD/DVD. You may write an image file to a blank CD/DVD
to get an identical copy of the original CD/DVD. Simply performing a direct
copy of an ISO image file to a CD/DVD will not write the directory and file
structure needed to use that CD/DVD.

Most CD/DVD writing software includes a feature to create a CD/DVD from
an image file.

There are several free programs, e.g. `ImgBurn`_.

Users on Mac OS X should use the Disk Utility, found in Applications
-> Utilities -> Disk Utility.

Users on `Ubuntu Linux`_ should use `Brasero`_.
