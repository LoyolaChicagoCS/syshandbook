Content Management and Hosting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We no longer provide support for static web page serving, PHP, and CGI
scripting. We realize that this might be an inconvenience to some. For
students doing project work, we can provide temporary `virtual
machines <../../department-services/virtualization/index.html>`_ on our
Xen cluster for web hosting projects.

We encourage those who need to set up web sites to consider establishing
web hosting account via one of the many providers out there, such as
Site 5 (`http://www.site5.com <http://www.site5.com>`_), which has
hosting plans as low as $5/month that give you full shell access and the
ability to set up your own domain name, etc.

We are able to provide many services (private or public sites) through
`Google Apps <../../department-services/google-apps-cs/index.html>`_;
however, this may not give you all of the scripting and programming
capabilities that are desired.
