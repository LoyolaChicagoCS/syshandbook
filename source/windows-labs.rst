Windows Labs
============

With our partner, Loyola Information Technology Services (ITS), we
ensure that CS and Math/Stats software needs are formally requested
from ITS. This allows us to focus on advanced computing needs (in
particular, Linux and server-side applications) and ensure ubiquitous
access to Windows labs via the Loyola login ID.

Faculty may request additional software by visiting \url{http://www.luc.edu/its/pdfs/instr_sw_inst_form.pdf},
or by sending an e-mail to the \emph{windows} alias (see section \vref{sec:Getting-Help}).
In the latter case, the lab manager (Miao Ye) will fill in a software
request on your behalf. You are encouraged to submit requests one
month before the end of the current term, if you need the software
in the summer or following term. For example, if you need software
in Fall 2009, consider getting your request in by April of 2008 (one
month before the Spring 2008 term ends). You should also indicate
in your request whether you are willing to help test the software
after it becomes available. We cannot be held responsible for late
requests or requests that do not have a designated faculty member
interested in testing.

Again, because the Windows hardware and software are now maintained
by ITS, we ask that all issues you encounter be reported, no matter
how trivial. If you discover broken hardware and/or software, use
the ITS Self Service application located at https://heatss.it.luc.edu/HeatLDAP/.
