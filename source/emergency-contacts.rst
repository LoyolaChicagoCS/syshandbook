Emergency Contacts
==================

Security is everyone's business. If you see something, say something, as
we are frequently reminded nowadays. The following numbers will help you
when you're on campus:

-  44-911: Campus Safety for all on-campus emergencies
-  911: for all emergencies off-campus
-  773-508-6039: Campus Safety for all non-emergency situations
-  312-915-7999: Computer Science department for all non-emergency
   situations (available during standard business hours only, 9am-5pm US
   Central)

Please report all computer security issues to helpdesk@luc.edu. You
should also CC the department's help alias (see `Getting
Help <../how-to/getting-help/index.html>`_) if the issue is one where
you think the CS department would also want to know.
