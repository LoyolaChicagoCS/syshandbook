General Computing Labs
----------------------

The department has general computer laboratories at the Lake Shore and
Water Tower Campuses. They are three windows labs and one free/open
source laboratory (at Water Tower Campus only) running Ubuntu Linux. The
Windows labs are managed by Information Technology Services (ITS) with
software requests submitted regularly by the department.

Internet-2
----------

The CS Department was part of a successful team that received funding to
bring Internet-2 to Loyola University Chicago as a whole. This
next-generation Internet allows students within the department to
explore ideas such as cluster computing, grid computing, Internet
telephony, and distributed scientific application development. In
addition to Internet-2, the university maintains a high-speed optical
network/ring that connects all of the Loyola campuses (LSC, WTC, and
Loyola University Medical Center).

Windows HPC Cluster
-------------------

Drs. Putonti and Thiruvathukal operate two Windows HPC clusters: an
80-node dual-core Opteron cluster by Rackable Systems and a 24-node
dual-core Xeon cluster by Dell. Both clusters feature high-speed
Ethernet and/or Infiniband. These clusters are housed in the ITS data
center.

GPGPU Server
------------

Our new GPGPU Server was set up at our ETL. It is SuperServer 7046GT-TRF-TC4
with 2 x Intel Xeon Quad-Core (16 logical processors), 96GB RAM, 4 x NVIDIAÂ®
Tesla C2075 GPUs. Please read our :doc:`gpgpu-server` guide on how to get
started.

Emerging Technologies Laboratory
--------------------------------

.. _ETL: http://www.etl.luc.edu

The `ETL`_ is a growing presence for experimental computer science and
engineering projects. This laboratory supports many experimental computing
needs and is a place where students can explore ideas not covered directly in
any particular class.  Virtualization, embedded systems, green computing, and
mobile development take place here.

Wireless
--------

The entire department (faculty offices, computer labs, emerging
technologies lab, and halls) are covered by 802.11g Wireless LAN.
