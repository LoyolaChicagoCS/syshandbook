IGnation and University Blogs/Wikis
===================================

.. _IGnation: http://ignation.luc.edu/

The university provides a system called `IGnation`_, which supports wikis and
blogs. While many of our users typically take advantage of publicly available
sources, e.g. Blogger and Wordpress, we would like to encourage our users to
consider these university-maintained sources as a starting point. 

Should these not be appropriate for your needs, we can establish a Google Site
for you via :doc:`google-apps-cs` for Your Domain (see below), which is a
feature-rich solution for maintaining public and private web sites, and (unlike
the university solution) can be used to collaborate with those outside of the
institution (as it is tied to e-mail addresses, not university IDs).
