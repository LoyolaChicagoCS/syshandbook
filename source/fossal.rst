Free/Open Source Software at Loyola
===================================


The department is active in free/open source software development in addition to the various "commercial" academic alliances. We encourage those who "need help" to consider joining FOSSAL, which is a student organization dedicated to all things FOSS.

FOSSAL  maintains a Google Group at http://groups.google.com/group/fossal. All are welcome to join (subject to approval to prevent spamming).
