User Accounts
=============

All students and faculty are given accounts in the CS department.  Your account
is intended for your use only. Please change your intial password immediately
on first use to improve security. (We are able to determine when a password has
not been changed from the default and will lock accounts after a certain
period.)

We presently lack a self-service mechanism to the PAM service maintained by ITS
for resetting your password. In any event, given the manageable number of
users, you can send a request to the accounts alias to have your password reset
for you. Since we set up all of our accounts to match your university login ID,
it is our policy to send your replacement password to your Loyola e-mail
address. You may also opt to meet the lab manager in person but must show your
Loyola or a government-issued id with your photo on it.

To reset your password, you should log into ``random.cs.luc.edu`` using a
secure shell client (a.k.a. SSH) and use the passwd program to reset it. We
recommend that you are on campus when you need to change your password.
